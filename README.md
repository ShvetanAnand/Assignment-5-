Assignment 5 of Android Club
\
In this Assignment we are supposed to create a list app using Redux with hooks 
\ 
For this I have chosen to make a gaming list (with gamery aesthetic and apperance ) in which anyone can add their opinions of best games to play 
\
I have created 2 main screens here which include GameForm and GameList using the help of the shared tutorial 
\
\
A detailed video of the app functioning is uploaded in the youtube link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skQoTuPV3JM

Screenshots of the app's Two screeens are attached below:
